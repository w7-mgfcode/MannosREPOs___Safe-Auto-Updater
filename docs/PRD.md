- **Manual Update Overhead**: Manual version tracking and updates are time-consuming and error-prone
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Delayed updates expose systems to known security vulnerabilities
- **Breaking Changes**: Automatic updates can introduce breaking changes and service disruptions
- **Inconsistent Policies**: Lack of standardized update policies across teams and environments
- **Rollback Complexity**: Limited automated rollback capabilities when updates fail

### 1.3 Solution Overview
Safe Auto-Updater provides:
- Automated discovery and inventory of Docker containers and Kubernetes resources
- Intelligent semantic versioning-based update policies
- Multi-layer health checks and automated rollback mechanisms
- Configurable diff gates to prevent dangerous updates
- Complete audit trail and monitoring integration
- Support for both Docker (via Watchtower) and Kubernetes (Helm) deployments
